Project 3 - Juicy Breakout
03/02/2025

A game developed for Game Tech Project 3.

## Implementation
Juicy Features [8]:
- Changed colors of blocks, walls, and the particle effect from the paddle.
- Sound Effects for Death, Paddle Hit, and Blocks Breaking
- Music on Main Menu and During the game
- Added Eyes to the Padddle
- ^ Eyes follow the ball (follow the action)
- Particles appear off of the Paddle when hit
- Screen Shakes when blocks are broken
- Bricks spawning in are animated (fade in/out)

Xtra Cred (Potentially) [2+?]:
- Ball has a trail
- Shaders on Main Menu
- Elements are animated? (I believe they are)
